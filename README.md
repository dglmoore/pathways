# Pathways - A Framework for Computing the Pathway Assembly Index on Generic Objects

**Disclaimer**: This project is in the **very** early stages of development. We have a basic
skeleton setup, but we still need to flesh out documentation, unit tests, continuous integration and
cross-platform builds.

## Getting Started

The build is only automated for Linux and macOS systems with `g++`. The source requires `gcc 8.0` or
higher.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/dglmoore/pathways
...
$ cd pathways
$ make
# Output will vary
$ ./bin/pathways
